# Cloudy Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The Cloudy CLI is used to write cloud agnostic/provider agnostic scripts for cloud configuration. In other words, you can write scripts that will do things like "store this in the cloud", or "compute this in the cloud" without having to interact directly with the AWS or gcloud CLI's. This means that your code is not directly dependent on proprietary programs, your code is decoupled from the cloud provider. This decoupling allows you to easily switch between different providers, a common issue that arises over time as your needs or your provider's features change. In addition, the Cloudy CLI supports using multiple providers for redundancy. The Cloudy CLI also makes it easy to transfer/rollover between cloud providers. The Cloudy CLI provides a layer of abstraction between your code and the cloud provider.
